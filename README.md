# KNN with Lyons Biomedical Data
As part of my Machine Learning class project, I worked with Biomedical data provided on this site (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/vertebral+column).
The dataset contained six biomechanical features to classify orthopaedic patients into two classes (normal or abnormal). Abnormal in this case is defined by having either a disk hernia or spondylolisthesis.
The primary classifier I used is K-nearest-neighbors and aimed to find the optimum k (# of neighbors) for both the training and test set in order to avoid overfitting.
I gained insightful knowledge about metrics of success such as precision, recall, and F-test for overall model significance.
I also familiarized myself with different distance measurements such as the Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and Minkowski distance.
